The tool reads URLs from a notepad file.
It opens a browser using the Puppeter library and navigates to each URL.
The tool captures a screenshot of each webpage.
It creates a folder for each URL to store its screenshots.
The tool saves the screenshot with the URL as the file name.
As a pentester myself, I understand the frustration of manually collecting data from a large number of URLs. That's why I created this tool to help streamline the process and make it more efficient.
